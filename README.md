Merchant Clothing Co. 
    by Federico Salinas

About the project:

I have seen websites where you can buy clothes but I have never seen websites where you can buy or trade clothes.. internationally. This application is designed with that purpose in mind. Anyone from all walks of life can use this application.

User Stories:

1. As a user I would like to browse the website smoothly.
2. As a user I would like to be able to post my own item that I would like to sell or exchange.
3. As a user I would like to choose from men and women categories of clothes.
4. As a user I would like to delete my item if I change my mind and do not want to have it posted anymore.
5. As a user I would like to be able to edit any field (item name/price/image/description) if I desire to do so.

Obstacles along the way:

1. As of right now I have not been able to implement the update/edit method.
2. As I have known, CSS is not my strongest point and it has proven to me true once again.
3. My images were not rendering for an entire day and I had to start my backend from scratch. (of course rails scaffold helped out a lot)


What I would like to work on in the future: 

1. I would like to have a search bar.
2. I still need to have a show route for my products.
3. I would like to have an add to cart feature.
4. I would want to have a payment method form that works.
5. I would want to also do user authentication to prevent chaos.
